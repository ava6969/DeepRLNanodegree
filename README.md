## NavigationProject
Train an agent to gather bananas in the Unity Banana Collector environment. Demonstrates Deep Q-Learning algorithm and the effects of various hyperparameter settings. Note that this version of the agent does not use image information from the environment, but rather uses state information directly in a 37-dimensional vector that includes ego-information and ray-based information about its surroundings.
